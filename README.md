# Clustering-on-Wine-Dataset
## Overview
In this project I have applied K-means clustering on the wine dataset with 13 columns for each datapoint.Initially assume k to be 3.Hence obtaining 3 clusters.Then I have appplied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 2 dimensions and plotted the clusters.To adjust the k-value to optimal number of clusters I used elbow method on k-values from 1-10 using inertia as the criteria.
